SETUP:

ASAP:
    Hide tools if showing (press {Alt} {Right} {Down} in order and make sure all items starting "Toggle" are unchecked)
    Sidebars do not need to be hidden; they will open every time the application starts and are closed automatically by the script

NDP.view 2:
    Click on the image to ensure the window is active
    Show slide map if not already open (press M)
    Set slide map to large (right click on slide map in lower right hand corner and select "Large Map")
    Hide slide map (press M)
    Settings: (press P)
        Set maximum digital zoom to none (Navigation > set first slider all the way to the left)
        Hide scale bar (Scale Bar > toggle first switch)
        Hide all widgets (Widgets > toggle first switch)
        Hide toolbar (Toolbar > toggle first switch)
    Maximize window (click maximize button next to close window button in upper right corner)

QuPath:
    Open settings (press {Ctrl}{+}{,} simultaneously)
    Uncheck "Check for updates on startup" box (if unable to find, simply search using the search bar at the top)
    Sidebars and other tools do not need to be hidden; they are closed automatically by the script

Sedeen:
    Hide application toolbar (press {Alt} V W A in order)
    Settings: (press {Ctrl}T simultaneously)
        Check "Show Zoombar" box if not checked
        In the box that displays "{number} x digital zoom", change to "1 x digital zoom"
        Uncheck "Show Thumbnail", "Show Zoombar", and "Show Cursor View" boxes
        Click "Apply" button at bottom

It is always advisable to open every viewer once before running the script just to check that all of the setup is done properly. Interrupting the execution of the scripts can affect future runs.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Put the target image in this folder. In the "viewer_interface" AHK script, update the "img_width", "img_height", "x1", "y1", "x2", and "y2" fields under "Input parameters". "img_width" and "img_height" are the dimensions of the WSI, in pixels. (x1, y1) represents the top left corner of the target image, in pixels, relative to the WSI. Likewise, (x2, y2) represents the lower right corner of the target image. Finally, in the "gen2" MATLAB script, update the global variable "wsi_path" to be the path of the WSI that the target image is taken from.

Run the "gen2" function from MATLAB. When the overlay comes up after the viewer has been opened and adjusted, pan and zoom as necessary to match the target. Press Alt-Shift-c in order to continue the script. The output can be found in the "matlab_scripts" folder.

FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:

The boundaries of the target image could be passed in to AHK, which would allow for running the whole script in batch for different target images.
